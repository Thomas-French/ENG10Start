    "While asphalt and concrete both have there own costs and benifits for driveways concrete is the best choice and is quickly becoming the standard. While the initial cost of concrete is slightly more expensive, asphalt \"costing \\\\$2.00 to \\\\$4.00 per square foot\" and \"concrete driveway cost(ing) between \\\\$4.00 and \\\\$6.00 per square foot\"[[1]](https://www.uniquepavingmaterials.com/asphalt-vs-concrete-driveways-which-is-right-for-you/), concrete makes up much of the initial investment with lower maintanance and repair costs. [[2]](https://concretesupplyco.com/concrete-vs-asphalt/)\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of concrete is its long lasting ability. When first both were first developed people explected concrete to last around as long or a slighty shorter than they expected asphalt to last. Asphalt was estimated to last 20-25 years and concrete 20 years. However, in day to day life asphalt on average last 5-7 years and concrete can last from up to 30 to even 50 years! [[2]](https://concretesupplyco.com/concrete-vs-asphalt/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Concrete also has another huge advantage. Concrete is 100% recyclable. Concrete is made out of natural and fully recyclable materials: sand, aggregates, and water. Concrete also doesn't produce toxic runoff. And with concrete being a lighter material light from the sun is reflected instead of absorbed. This helps locally by saving energy on air conditioning but also helps with global warming in a similar way to the \"iceburg effect\"[[3]](https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/how-icebergs-are-connected-to-climate-change-and-tourism).
